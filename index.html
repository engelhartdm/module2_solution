			I'm traveling in some vehicle; I'm sitting in some cafe,a defector from the petty wars that shell shock love away. There's comfort in melancholy when there's no need to explain. It's just as natural as the weather in this moody sky today. In our possessive coupling, so much could not be expressed. So now I'm returning to myself these things that you and I suppressed. I see something of myself in everyone, just at this moment of the world, as snow gathers like bolts of lace waltzing on a ballroom girl.
